# psoutils

This is a library that includes some useful things when working on with PSO Gamecube related projects:

* **PRS compression**. This is a conversion of the original Fuzziqer C++ implementation found in [newserv](https://github.com/fuzziqersoftware/newserv) with some minor bug fixes.
* **Encryption**. This is also a conversion of the original Fuzziqer C++ implementation found in [newserv](https://github.com/fuzziqersoftware/newserv).
* **Quest Files**. Support for reading and writing both .bin/.dat and .qst file formats.
* **Text Encoding**. Basic support for the language/text encoding that PSO Gamecube files use.
* **Packet Structures**. Fairly incomplete (will be expanded on over time) structures used in PSO's network protocol.
